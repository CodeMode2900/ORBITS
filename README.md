# Orbital System Simulation with Python and Pygame

This project is a Python simulation of an orbital system using the Pygame library. It visualizes the motion of planets and moons in a solar system-like setting, with gravitational interactions governed by Newtonian mechanics. Each planet and moon is represented by a colored circle, with their orbital paths traced over time.


## Features

- Simulates planetary orbits and moon movements using Python and Pygame.
- Demonstrates gravitational interactions based on Newton's law of gravitation.
- Provides a visual representation of celestial bodies and their orbits.
- Includes random starfield background for added realism.
